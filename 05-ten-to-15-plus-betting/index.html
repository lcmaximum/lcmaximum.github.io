<p>It's time to start putting the pieces together! Here, the basic game logic from 'Ten to 15'
    replaces the game logic from Coin Flip, and after many rounds of play (and way too many losses
    for a game i designed myself!) we have a working, if not super-fun or stylish, game of betting and chance.

<p>About style: I'm aware that these projects have, as they say, zero drip. I've found it way too
    easy to fall down a CSS rabbit hole when I should be focusing on my app's functionality - only to emerge hours later
    with a page that looks like I made it in MS Paint.  So for my practice projects, I'm keeping styling
    to a minimum. That said, I definitely want to shout out 100 Bytes To Make Your Page Not Shit 
    (i will put a real link here). It's just enough design to look intentional, and just these few lines
    contain a whole lot of CSS wisdom.
