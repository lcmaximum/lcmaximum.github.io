Finally, a game that can technically be called Blackjack! Having the logic in place for a smaller number of un-styled cards
made it much easier than I expected to plunk in the full deck from my second project. The last thing to do (before I finally get to play with the styling) is 
to combine all 3 projects by adding betting logic to this one.</p>

<p>I'm realizing that this blog is basically my own kind of version control. Git/hub is another area where I'll need
  a lot of practice before I can even Google my questions properly!
