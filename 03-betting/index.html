      Trying to add betting to my Blackjack assignment ate up a lot of time
      before i gave up and handed in "No-Stakes Blackjack". Returning to the
      game after graduating by the skin of my teeth, I made multiple attempts to
      add bank & betting on top of the 'finished' product, only to have it wreak
      havoc on scoring and layout. Subsequent attempts at debugging just made a
      bigger mess (much like Homer visiting the past in Treehouse of Horror.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I realized if I was going to figure out betting logic, it had to be
      isolated from the complexity of potential Blackjack outcomes. I went with
      the simplest game of chance possible - a coin flip - and focused on the
      logic of "guess right, add money, guess wrong, subtract money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking it back to basics helped me better understand the separation of
      interests in game logic - in an earlier attempt, i was defining all 5
      possible Blackjack outcomes, adding or subtracting from the bank, and
      updating the DOM all within the same function. Of course I couldn't change
      one thing without breaking another!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in this little 2-outcome game, my code has room for improvement. For
      example, I ended up defining two separate callback functions (confirmHeads
      and confirmTails) rather than using event delegation to simply
      'confirmUserChoice'. With only two outcomes, it seemed like more work than
      it was worth, but in future projects, I'll need a better understanding of
      event delegation.
